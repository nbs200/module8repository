 The Gaming Room project involved creating a multi-platform gaming application for the client. The aim was to develop a game accessible on various devices and operating systems, ensuring a seamless gaming experience for users. The documentation process was thorough and well structured, clearly outlining project goals, requirements, technical specifications, and timelines, which facilitated smooth communication and project management. 

 Working through the design document was particulary helpful as it required careful consideration of every aspect of the project before the coding began. This approach helped identify potential issues early on and served as a roadmap for the coding process. One area for improvement would be the user interface design section, where more detailed mock-ups and user flow diagrams enhanced understanding of the users journey through the application. The design approach included requirement analysis, design, implementation, testing, and deployment. In future projects, I think more user testing early in the design process would be very beneficial because there would be feedback to make the necessary adjustment.
